                    <h3>&emsp;&emsp; Confucianism, one of the core philosophies of traditional Chinese culture,
                        was founded by Confucius and has been passed down and developed through the generations to form
                        a far-reaching system of thought.
                        With “benevolence” as its core, it emphasizes moral cultivation,
                        social responsibility and harmony between the family and the nation,
                        and has had a profound impact on Chinese history, social systems, ethics and personal codes of
                        conduct.
                        The basic concepts of Confucianism include the five virtues of benevolence, propriety,
                        righteousness, wisdom and trust, as well as the concern for social order.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;In China, Confucianism became the ruling ideology of feudal society and shaped
                        the bureaucratic and legal systems of ancient China.
                        Confucianism established ethical concepts such as filial piety and loyalty to the ruler, and
                        shaped family and social relations.
                        The imperial examination system promoted the popularization of Confucianism by using Confucian
                        classics as examination content.

                        simplicity and romance of the Classic of Poetry and the Chu Rhetoric to the peak of poetry in
                        the Tang Dynasty,
                        and then to the euphony and grandeur of the Song lyrics, and the popularization and artistic
                        variety of the Yuan operas.
                        With its condensed language, rich emotions and unique mood, poetry expresses profound thoughts
                        on nature, life and society, showing rich layers from individual mind to national sentiment.
                        It is not only an important carrier for expressing feelings and aspirations, but also a cultural
                        mirror for recording social reality, and still exudes a constant charm in world literature.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Chinese calligraphy is a unique art form in Chinese culture, which is a perfect
                        combination of writing and artistic aesthetics.
                        It originated from the creation and development of Chinese characters, from oracle bone script
                        and gold script to seal script and official script,
                        and then to regular script, running script and cursive script, various fonts have been gradually
                        enriched with the evolution of history, displaying unique artistic charm.
                        Calligraphy not only emphasizes the structure of characters and the rhythm of strokes, but also
                        pursues vividness and far-reaching meaning,
                        reflecting the concepts of “unity of heaven and mankind” and “mediocrity and harmony” in Chinese
                        philosophy.
                        Famous calligraphers such as Wang Xizhi of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, famous for his Lanting
                        Preface, is known as the “Sage of Calligraphy”;
                        Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan of the Tang Dynasty laid the foundation of standardized
                        calligraphy with their majestic and upright regular scripts.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Calligraphy, as an important symbol of traditional Chinese culture, is not only
                        a writing skill, but also a way to cultivate one's body and spirit,
                        and has conveyed the essence of culture and thought to people for thousands of years.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Chinese painting is a unique painting art of the Chinese nation, using brushes and
                        rice paper as the main tools and materials, and integrating Chinese philosophy, aesthetics and
                        cultural ideas. It is an important representative of traditional Chinese art. Chinese painting
                        has a long history of origin, and through its historical development, it has formed three major
                        thematic painting disciplines: landscapes, figures, and birds and flowers. The creation of
                        Chinese painting emphasizes “writing God in form”, focusing on the expression of subjective
                        emotions and the harmony of natural scenery, and emphasizing the creation of mood rather than
                        the mechanical reproduction of objective reality.

                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;The techniques of Chinese painting include two styles: brushwork, which is fine
                        and realistic and is commonly seen in ancient court paintings, and freehand, which is more
                        lyrical and expresses meaning with concise ink and brushwork. Famous painters such as Gu Kaizhi
                        of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, whose “Women's History” embodies the essence of figure painting;
                        Jing Hao and Guan Tong of the Fifth Generation created the majestic style of landscape painting
                        in the north; Fan Kuan and Guo Xi of the Northern Song Dynasty pushed landscape painting to its
                        peak, showing the “soul of mountains and rivers”. Meanwhile, bird and flower paintings such as
                        Cui Bai in the Song Dynasty and Bada Shanren in the Ming and Qing Dynasties use fresh and
                        elegant brushstrokes to outline the beauty of nature.

                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Chinese painting is not only a visual art, but also a comprehensive expression
                        of the integration of poetry, calligraphy, painting and printing. It shows infinite heaven and
                        earth and feelings through limited ink and brushwork, carries the Chinese people's profound
                        thinking about nature, life and the universe, and is a vivid embodiment of the spirit of Chinese
                        culture.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Chinese opera is a treasure of traditional Chinese art, a comprehensive stage art
                        form integrating literature, music, dance, performance and fine arts. It originated from
                        primitive songs and dances and folk raps, and through thousands of years of development, it has
                        gradually formed a variety of styles represented by Beijing Opera, Kunqu, Yueju Opera, Huangmei
                        Opera, Yu Opera, etc., and has become one of the important symbols of Chinese culture.

                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Opera is characterized by virtuality and programming. The stage sets and props
                        are extremely simple, but time, space and plot are skillfully presented through the highly
                        artistic performances of the actors. Based on the “four skills” of singing, reciting, acting and
                        playing, and in conjunction with face painting, costumes and unique musical accompaniment (such
                        as gongs, drums and strings), the actors show the characters' personalities and emotions. The
                        singing style varies according to the type of opera, such as the high and melodious voice of
                        Peking Opera and the soft and elegant voice of Kunqu Opera, all of which have a high aesthetic
                        value.

                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Chinese opera is not only a form of art and entertainment, but also a
                        concentration of national history and culture. Its content covers historical stories, folk
                        legends and social life, and conveys traditional values such as loyalty, filial piety,
                        patriotism and righteousness. As an intangible cultural heritage, Chinese opera carries the
                        spiritual world and cultural memories of the Chinese people, and still glows with unique
                        artistic charms on the modern stage and in international exchanges.
