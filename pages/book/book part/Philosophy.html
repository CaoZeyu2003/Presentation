               <h3>The Book of Changes, one of the classical Chinese texts,One of the three great strange books of ancient China, is a divination book used by ancient Chinese sorcerers to deduce future auspiciousness, evil and good fortune, and has been revered as one of the "Five Classics" since the Han Dynasty; The Book of Changes uses a set of symbols to systematically describe the changes of things, expressing the philosophy and cosmology of classical Chinese culture. Its central idea is that the hexagram composed of yin and yang symbols represents the operating state of all things in the world. The diviners asked the gods about their affairs and obtained hexagrams, so that they could predict the success or failure of events (e.g., wars, political affairs, agricultural harvests, etc.)[1]. As a book of divination, the influence of the Book of Changes is not limited to divination and arithmetic, but also in ancient Chinese philosophy, religion, politics, economics, medicine, astronomy, arithmetic, literature, music, art, military and martial arts. Beginning in the 17th century, the I Ching was introduced to Europe and the United States by missionaries of the Catholic Society of Jesus.

                The Analects (Lún yǔ) is a collection of quotations compiled by the disciples and descendants of Confucius, a thinker and educator in the Spring and Autumn Period, to record the words and deeds of Confucius and his disciples. It was completed in the early Warring States Period. The book consists of 20 chapters and 492 chapters, mainly in the form of quotations, supplemented by narratives. It more concentratedly reflects the political views, ethical thoughts, moral concepts, and educational principles of Confucius and the Confucian school. Most of the works are quotations, but the words are concise and the meaning is rich. Some sentences and chapters are vivid. Its main characteristics are concise language, easy to understand, and profound meaning. It has a graceful, gentle, slow and implicit style, and can show the image of characters in simple dialogues and actions.

               The book "Mozi" is mostly a collection of records of Mozi's words and deeds by Mozi's disciples or their disciples. It is the direct material for studying Mozi's thoughts. Among them, "Jing Shang", "Jing Xia", "Jing Shuo Shang", "Jing Shuo Xia", "Da Qu" and "Xiao Qu" are the works of the later Mohist school. Some people also believe that "Jing Shang" and "Jing Xia" are the works of Mozi. Mozi's basic propositions are: oppose exploitation and advocate labor; oppose bullying the weak with the strong, advocate universal love and non-aggression; oppose Confucian rituals and music, advocate frugal burials and frugal spending; oppose hereditary nobles and hereditary salaries, and advocate respect for the virtuous and the same. Therefore, in Mozi's later years, Confucianism and Mohism were equally famous. After his death, Mohist disciples were still "filled the world" and "innumerable", so although there were hundreds of schools of thought in the Warring States Period, "Confucianism and Mohism" was the first among the hundreds of schools.
