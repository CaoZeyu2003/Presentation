               <h3>China's modern history is a period of history from the Opium War in 1840 to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. During this period, China suffered from the invasion of foreign powers and gradually became a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. In order to resist foreign aggression and feudal oppression, the Chinese people carried out many revolutions and reforms, including the Westernization Movement, the Reform Movement of 1898, and the Revolution of 1911. After the founding of the Communist Party of China, it led the Chinese people in the New Democratic Revolution, and eventually overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism and established a new China. This period of history was full of twists and turns and hardships, but the Chinese people have always been indomitable and have worked hard to achieve national independence and people's liberation.
