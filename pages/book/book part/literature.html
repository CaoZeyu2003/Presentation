                 "Camel Xiangzi" tells the story of Xiangzi, a young and strong rickshaw driver full of vitality in the city of Beiping, China.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Coming from the countryside, Xiangzi is a bankrupt young farmer, hardworking, simple, and kind, who keeps everything that the countryside has nurtured and nurtured him, but he is never willing to go back to the countryside. Xiangzi, who came to the city from the countryside, longed to buy a car of her own with her honest labor. Being an independent laborer was xiangzi's will, hope, and even religion, and with hard work and perseverance, he spent three years saving money and finally realized his dream of becoming a self-reliant high-class coachman. But just half a year later, the car was taken away by deserters in the chaos, and Xiangzi lost the foreign car and only brought back three camels. Xiangzi was not discouraged, he still stubbornly started from scratch, pulling the car and saving money more self-restraint. However, before he could buy a car again, all his savings were blackmailed and looted by detectives, and his dream of buying a car came to naught again.
         </h3>
            <h3>
                Xiangzi once again pulls her own car at the cost of a deformed marriage with a tiger girl. Unfortunately, the good times did not last long, because Hu Niu died in childbirth, he had to sell the rickshaw to take care of the funeral. At this point, his life ideals were completely shattered. Coupled with the suicide of his beloved woman Xiaofuzi, the last spark of hope in his heart was extinguished. After being hit by life, Xiangzi began to lose any desire and confidence in life, and could no longer muster up the courage to live, and was no longer as proud of pulling a cart as before, he hated pulling a cart and hated labor.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Xiangzi, who was teased by life, began to play life, eating, drinking, prostituting and gambling. In order to drink, Xiangzi cheated money everywhere and degenerated into "city garbage". In the end, he made a living by doing handymen for people's ceremonies. Xiangzi was reduced from a "decent, strong, dreamy, self-interested, personal, robust, and great" low-level laborer to a "degenerate, selfish, unfortunate, socially sick child, and an individualistic doomsday."
